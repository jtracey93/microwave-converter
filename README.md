# ðŸ”¥ Microwave Time Converter

A responsive static web app that helps users convert microwave cooking times between different wattages. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, optimized for mobile devices and ready for Azure Static Web Apps deployment.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Real-time Validation**: Input validation with helpful error messages
- **PWA Ready**: Installable as a Progressive Web App with offline capabilities
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean, modern UI with smooth animations
- **Quick Select**: Common wattage buttons for faster input
- **Detailed Results**: Clear explanations of the conversion calculations

## How It Works

The app uses the energy equivalency formula to convert cooking times:

```
New Time = (Original Time Ã— Recipe Wattage) Ã· Your Wattage
```

This ensures that the same amount of energy is delivered to your food, regardless of the microwave's wattage.

## Usage

1. Enter the wattage specified in the cooking instructions
2. Input the cooking time (minutes and seconds)
3. Enter your microwave's wattage
4. Click "Calculate Cooking Time" to get the adjusted time

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with accessibility features
- **CSS3**: Modern styling with CSS Grid, Flexbox, and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Vanilla JavaScript with modern features
- **Progressive Web App**: Service worker for offline functionality
- **Font Awesome**: Icons for enhanced UI
- **Google Fonts**: Poppins font family
